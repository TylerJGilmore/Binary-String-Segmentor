Compiling the C++ file will run a console. 
Inserting a long string of end-to-end binary with no spaces will output a cleaner result by spacing out the binary.

A compiler is required to run the program. (GNU G++ etc.)

Yes this could be done cleaner in Python but i wanted something one-offy and usable.
A Python version will be published in the future.

The program does not perform any string operations but it outputs a result as the user input is read.
